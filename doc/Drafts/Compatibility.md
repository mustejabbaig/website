# Compatibility 
## General

- The aplication runs in a web browser, so os compatibility is handled there and is optimized for every os


## co-exsstence
- when the webaplication runs local, it can only performe efficent to limit of available resources of the system without interfearing with other tasks
- when the application runs on a server the limit of performance without interfearing with other tasks is limited by the system resources 
- the total bandwith and speed to upload a picture is limited by the server hardware and routing. Upload is only efficent until hardware limitations of the server is reached. (when run local, the upload speed is limited by drive speed, processor and ram from the local system)
- every layer is on its own, the number of layers that can co-exist is determinet by hardware limitation
- when an instance is closed all the system resources get freed and can be used in a new process that allready exsist
- only one selection can co-exsist
- multiple textfields can exsist at once
- multiple effects can co exsist on one layer

## Interoperability
- different users should not be able to edit the same session of a picture so there is no exchange between sessions at all
- User have different sessions so there is no interferance when uploading a picture
limitation
- parts of layers can be paste to other layers 
- the picture that was saved can be used in a new process
- selectet text can be copyed and pastet to another textfield
- specific effect settings can be copyed to another layer/object
