As we develop the image editing program, adherence to ISO/IEC 25000 series (SQuaRE) standards for reliability is a priority. The following outlines our planned strategies to ensure reliability throughout the software's lifecycle:

# Maturity:
To achieve a mature product, our development process will include a robust testing regimen consisting of unit tests for low-level code verification and comprehensive user testing to ensure that the functionality meets the practical needs of end-users. Our goal is to minimize the defect rate to a target that is well below the accepted threshold for image editing applications, which will be determined as we progress in the development.

# Fault Tolerance:
The image editing program will be engineered with advanced fault tolerance mechanisms. Exception handling routines will be integrated throughout the software to handle operational anomalies without disrupting user workflow. This design strategy will be subjected to rigorous fault injection testing to ensure that it is capable of maintaining operational continuity in the face of system-level errors.

# Recoverability:
A key feature for our users will be a robust ‘undo/redo’ functionality, which will allow them to recover from mistakes or experiment with different editing options. This feature will support recovery of multiple steps, with the exact number being finalized based on user needs and technical feasibility assessments.

# Availability:
The architecture of our image editing program is planned with high availability as a critical objective. To this end, we will be contracting with a third-party web server provider known for reliable service and high uptime guarantees. Our selection criteria will prioritize providers offering redundancy in their hosting solutions and a commitment to at least 99.9% uptime to match industry standards.

Additionally, we plan to design our application with failover capabilities and implement a strategy for regular backups and maintenance that aligns with the service level agreements (SLAs) provided by our hosting partner. This approach will help minimize service disruptions and ensure that our users can access our image editing tools reliably whenever they need them.
