Regarding **Performance Efficiency**, the editor should perform all common operations we're planning to implement, for example cropping or brush tools quickly. The user will expect real-time feedback as they try to make changes to their image. In the case of algorithmically intense operations which cannot be completed (almost) instantly, a progress bar will be shown, so that the user receives feedback that their changes are in progress to reduce confusion. The programm will be mindful of resource usage, so that simple operations don't use up an unneccesary amount of memory or CPU power. Proper error handling and meaningful error messages in the case of unexpected issues, will enhance ease of use and eliminate user frustration as much as possible (further outlined in the section regarding **Reliability**) All this along with a responsive UI, will also allow for a smooth and performant user experience.
When it comes to operations and algorithms, efficient image processing algorithms and suitable data structures (for example processing pictures in a consistent way even across file types) will be implemented for further optimization.
