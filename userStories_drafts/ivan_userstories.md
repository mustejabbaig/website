• A person that does not have access to dedicated photo-editing software such as Photoshop should be able to quickly and intuitively make use 
of our program. It will have more functionality than a very simple program such as Microsoft Paint, whilst not being as complex as something 
like Photoshop. And accessible from any computer, as it is a web application.
A common user story related to this would be older people. Many would certainly have problems installing new image-editing software or even 
finding pre-installed image-editing software on their computers (as older people are now also starting to have computers) - I myself am on 
a Macbook, and was not able to find any image editing software on par with Microsoft Paint on my machine when just blindly looking through 
all of my programs. Having a web application that you only need to know the link for, before opening it and editing images, would make it 
that much more accessible.

• If a user wants to make use of the program to edit a photo for social media purposes, the program will have enough functionality to do this. 
All of the most common types of tools one can use on a photo will be available - filters, cropping (and by extension "zooming"), brush, rotate, 
etc. - and the best part is that the web application allows you to then save the image as any image type you want, and also compress it as you 
see fit - two things that are very important to keep in mind when preparing photos to post online. Of course all of this isn't only limited to 
social media, and has many use cases in the realm of emailing, as well as college and work projects - where often a file is required to be a 
specific file type, and a specific size (see: ISIS, email size limit). All of that can also be specifically very useful to Web Designers and 
normal designers.

• Apart from that, designers and photographers can avail of the advanced features the program provides. For example, the compression feature 
will literally snip away all the least "information-heavy" parts of the image until the image fits a certain file size or certain proportions.
This can be very useful as professionals working with images often have to work according to very specific criteria, be it for website layouts,
graphics, photo portfolios and photo collections. Another example would be the 'Smart Select Tool' - allowing more dynamic selection 
functionality that isn't only limited to the other selection types already detailed in the requirements analysis. 

• The program is also meant to be fool-proof and mistake-proof on the part of the users. Whether it be older/younger users that have less 
experience with technology or simply don't want to be too meticulous in the use of the program, or professionals employing it for detailed 
sophisticated work. Sufficient functionality will be implemented so that changes can always be reversed, as well as warning the user of changes 
that may potentially be undesired and accidental. Examples include the "undo" and "redo" buttons, the program asking the user if they are sure 
they want to overwrite the current project with a new one (in the case of trying load in an image when another one is already open), asking them 
if they are sure they don't want to save changes (if the image has not yet been saved/downloaded), as well as asking the user if they are sure 
they want to remove the last layer of the project if they attempt to do so.

• In terms of layout and icons, the design will be made as intuitive for new and experienced users of similar programs as possible. We will 
look for similarities in icon designs and layouts of similar programs and design our own accordingly, so that for a user that has been using 
Photoshop or Pixlr for example, the transition to the program will be as easy as possible. We will not be copying or taking anything, but rather 
looking at what many of the most famous image-editing programs have in common in terms of design, and using these same principles in our program. 
A relevant user story that stems from this would be groups working on a project, especially one that is either amateur or low-budget, where the 
accessibility of the software and usability of it in terms of design would allow people from all kinds of backgrounds (coming from other software,
or a lack of experience in image-editing in general) to all work within one editing environment (which is vital when certain stylistic criteria 
have to be meet for everything that is done - e.g. all parts of a website, advertisement, etc.). As well as that, the program's existence on the 
web and free price means everyone in the group will have access to it, and is generally preferrable to making sure everybody in the group has 
access to more expensive software such as Photoshop, which can be incredibly cumbersome when the budget is low or nonexistent.
